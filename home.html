    <h2>Why ppl fail to achieve in the workplace</h2>

    <h1>Introduction part</h1>
    <h3><a href="intro.html">First indto</a></h3>

    <h3>Stress and time pressure:</h3>
    <p>
      When under pressure to make a quick decision, people may not thoroughly
      evaluate all options and make rushed choices. Lack of information or
      understanding: Not having enough knowledge about a situation or the
      potential consequences of a decision can lead to poor choices.
    </p>

    <h3>Poor communication:</h3>
    <p>
      Misunderstandings or lack of clarity in communication can result in
      incorrect assumptions and bad decisions. Personal agendas: Individuals
      might prioritize their own interests over the best interests of the
      company when making decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Emotional influence:</h3>
    <p>
      Strong emotions like anger or excitement can cloud judgment and lead to
      impulsive decisions. Groupthink: When team members conform to the majority
      opinion without critically evaluating all options, leading to poor group
      decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Lack of accountability:</h3>
    <p>
      When individuals don't feel responsible for the consequences of their
      decisions, they may be more likely to make poor choices.
    </p>

    <h3>Organizational culture:</h3>
    <p>
      A company culture that discourages dissent or critical thinking can
      contribute to poor decision-making.
    </p>

    <h3>"What are the three things you do that add value?"</h3>
    <p>
      Example Answer: Problem-Solving and Analytical Thinking: I excel at
      analyzing complex problems and delivering practical solutions. My
      background in mathematics and software development enables me to approach
      challenges logically and efficiently. Adaptability and Continuous
      Learning: I am always eager to learn and adapt to new tools, technologies,
      and environments. Transitioning from teaching to software development is
      an example of how I embrace change and continuously upskill to add value.
      Collaboration and Communication: I value teamwork and clear communication.
      Whether working in agile teams or mentoring others, I ensure that
      collaboration leads to successful and timely project delivery.
    </p>

    <h3>What three words would people use to describe you?"</h3>
    <p>
      Example Response: Adaptable: I quickly adjust to new challenges and
      environments, ensuring I stay productive and focused. Collaborative: I
      work effectively with teams, contributing positively to shared goals.
      Analytical: I approach problems logically, ensuring efficient and
      well-thought-out solutions.

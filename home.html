    <h2>Why ppl fail to achieve in the workplace</h2>

    <h3>Stress and time pressure:</h3>
    <p>
      When under pressure to make a quick decision, people may not thoroughly
      evaluate all options and make rushed choices. Lack of information or
      understanding: Not having enough knowledge about a situation or the
      potential consequences of a decision can lead to poor choices.
    </p>

    <h3>Poor communication:</h3>
    <p>
      Misunderstandings or lack of clarity in communication can result in
      incorrect assumptions and bad decisions. Personal agendas: Individuals
      might prioritize their own interests over the best interests of the
      company when making decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Emotional influence:</h3>
    <p>
      Strong emotions like anger or excitement can cloud judgment and lead to
      impulsive decisions. Groupthink: When team members conform to the majority
      opinion without critically evaluating all options, leading to poor group
      decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Lack of accountability:</h3>
    <p>
      When individuals don't feel responsible for the consequences of their
      decisions, they may be more likely to make poor choices.
    </p>

    <h3>Organizational culture:</h3>
    <p>
      A company culture that discourages dissent or critical thinking can
      contribute to poor decision-making.

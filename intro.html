    I am Kavitha, originally from India and currently residing in Stockholm,
    Sweden, in Liljeholmen. I hold a Master’s degree in Mathematics and have an
    extensive background as a lecturer, with over 11 years of teaching
    experience in India and Oman. During this time, I specialized in teaching
    engineering students and developed strong skills in mentoring,
    problem-solving, and project organization. After moving to Sweden, I
    transitioned into the field of coding, building on the computer science
    foundation I gained during my bachelor’s studies. I successfully completed a
    three-month intensive training program in full-stack JavaScript development
    at SALT, where I honed my skills in modern web technologies. Following this,
    I gained hands-on experience as a developer before taking a maternity break.
    During this time, I continued to upskill, focusing on software testing and
    development. Recently, I joined a Python development course at Lexicon IT
    Proffs to deepen my expertise in Python, databases, cloud computing, and AI.
    Now, I am actively seeking internship and job opportunities where I can
    apply my technical skills and grow further in the software development
    field."
